Method of finite elements for Poisson equation [demonstration of the concept]
==============================================

The package includes a single HTML page where the corresponding matrix of rigidness can be computed for Poisson's equation.

In order to obtain the matrix it is necessary to follow these steps:

1. Shape a polygon by choosing edge points. The points can be chosen by clicking on the black-bordered canvas. To enclose the polygon make a final click close to the first point. The final polygon will be displayed at the end of this step.
2. Define new points inside the polygon. These points are necessary to perform a triangulation of the area. 
3. Once the area is triangulated you can click on 'Draw table' button to obtain the matrix of the coefficients.
